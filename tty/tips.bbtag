    title:Rolling Release Tips;
    description:Rolling release Linux distros are a great way to get the latest software, but that does not come without potential problems. Users should have a good understanding of Linux before attempting to use one as their main distro.
**-** Rolling release means no set release schedule{semi} new software is released when it is ready.
**-** Rolling release means always up to date.  Expect several relatively large updates per week.
**-** Rolling release distros should be kept up to date.  Update checks should be ran *at least* once a week.
**-** Rolling release means less time to test packages.  Be prepared for potential issues.
**__Skills a User Should Have Before Using a Rolling Release Distro__**
**-** Know how to troubleshoot problems.  Be familiar with the different logging systems for Linux and how to find useful output from them.
**-** Know the general concept of how a package manager works on Linux.
**-** Know how packages on Linux interact with eachother.  Be aware of how dependencies work.
**-** Know how to properly partition a Linux drive.
**-** Know how to work in a terminal.  Terminals give more useful output when managing packages.  Be prepared to work without a GUI at all in case something breaks.
**-** Know how to work with drivers.  Frequent kernel updates can sometimes mean driver issues.  Know how to troubleshoot these issues.
**__Recommended Rolling Release Distros__**
**-** [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) (see `sudo distro info opensuse` and `sudo tips tumbleweed`)
**-** [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) (see `sudo distro info arch`);}};

    description:**__SELinux__**
**-** This is a common barrier for new Fedora users.  SELinux is a security measure that many think over-steps it's boundaries.
**-** The easiest solution if SELinux is blocking an application you need is to put it into permissive mode: `sudo setenforce 0`
**__Fedy__**
**-** [Fedy](https://www.folkswithhats.org/) essentially puts a list of some of the more common proprietary applications or harder to enable tweaks into a nice consise menu of one-click setups.
**__Recommended Third-Party Repos__**
**-** [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration)
  **\*** Where you'll likely find most of the applications and tools you need that aren't in the official repos.
**-** [Negativo17](https://negativo17.org/repositories/)
  **\***  If you'd rather enable one repo per application instead of one huge one, this is the route you should go.
**-** [Flathub](https://flathub.org/home)
  **\*** Not technically a third party repo but Fedora does have Flatpak enabled by default, so if all of the proprietary applications are available, it's worth trying out.
  **\*** Flatpaks are sandboxes and typically come with tight file permissions, so some functions may not work or may require you to manually override file perms.}};
